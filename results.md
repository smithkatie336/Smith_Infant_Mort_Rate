#Country location within South America does not indicate infant mortality rate#

The QGIS choropleth map of infant mortality rates in South America show, that although both southern countries Chile and Argentina display a lower infant mortality rate compared to the other countries in South America, the location of the country within the continent does not indicate a pattern in infant mortality rate.

#Infant mortality rate has a strong negative correlation with GDP per capita but a positive correlation with adolescent fertility rate and percent mortality from communicable diseases. Only GDP per capita is significantly associated with infant mortality rates#

The correlation between infant mortality and GDP per capita was -0.88578, suggesting a strong negative correlation. This can be observed in the scatterplot created to visualize the relationship between the two variables. With the exception of a small cluster of data points in the center of the graph, the scatterplot shows a linear downward trend. This result suggests the higher the GDP per capita, the lower the infant mortality rate.

The correlation between infant mortality and adolescent fertility rate is moderately positive at 0.6379. However, the scatterplot for this relationship shows the data points are relatively spread out rather than closer to a linear relationship. Similarly, the correlation between infant mortality and percent mortality by communicable diseases is positive at 0.59054. The scatterplot for this relationship also shows rather spread out data points, suggesting these variables may not be associated with infant mortality rate.

To determine whether the variables tested are also correlated with each other, which may influence the results, a heatmap correlation matrix amongst all the variables was conducted. Both percent mortality by communicable diseases and adolescent fertility rate were strongly negatively correlated with GDP per capita (-0.77 and -0.74, respectively). This suggests the positive correlation observed between infant mortality rates and adolescent fertility rates and percent mortality by communicable diseases may be a result of their correlation with GDP per capita.

In order to evaluate whether these variables are significantly associated with infant mortality, a linear  regression was run in STATA on infant mortality by all three variables. The regression revealed that only GDP per capita is significantly associated with infant mortality (p = 0.005). According to the results, a one dollar increase in GDP per capita is associated with a 0.0012 unit decrease in infant mortality rate in South America in 2016.

#Conclusion and Future Directions#

An analysis of infant mortality rates in South America in 2016 revealed that, of the three variables tested, only GDP per capita was significantly associated with infant mortality rates. For each one dollar increase in GDP per capita, the infant mortality rate is expected to decrease by 0.0012 units. However, this relationship warrants further study. Although it makes sense that the country's access to more money would translate to better health outcomes, this outcome is likely due to another effect of higher GDP per capita such as better access to hospitals with trained doctors rather than the money itself. Therefore, future directions for this study could include the identification of other variables affected by GDP per capita that could explain the decrease in infant mortality rate observed.
